# Getting Started

To access this folder from RStudio do the following:

1) Open RStudio
2) Run the code `install.packages("usethis")` if you need to install the `usethis` package.
3) Run the code `usethis::use_course("corinne-riddell/marginal-standardization")` in the RStudio console to download this folder.
4) R will ask you two questions - select the affirmative option for both questions.
5) RStudio will then launch a new window and we will run through the code together.
